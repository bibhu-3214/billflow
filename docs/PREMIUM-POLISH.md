**BillFlow: interface refinement — 31 October 2026**

Guided billing setup now shows real progress and the next incomplete action. Route loading has a structured skeleton, and the empty invoice panel has clearer visual hierarchy.

All new visual styling uses Tailwind utilities. Strict TypeScript remains enabled. Existing records, import formats, account behavior and the running app services are preserved.

Verified locally: strict checks, production build, 160 frontend/domain tests and 2 passing browser cases in this pass. The connected-app tests use temporary databases; BillFlow uses fictional browser-only accounts and Perqelle uses isolated browser contexts. New recovery tests preserve saved browser storage, and the connected tests verify that the main workspace module is deferred until sign-in.

Repeat with the existing check, test, build and browser commands. `PLAYWRIGHT_CHANNEL=chrome` selects installed Chrome for local browser checks. Screenshots and detailed logs are in `/private/tmp/portfolio-premium-polish-20261031/`.

This pass is local and uncommitted on `feat/premium-workspace-polish`. The earlier accessibility baseline remains documented in `QUALITY-BASELINE.md`. Public-release readiness and remote CI outcomes are separate from this local validation.

The subsequent performance and draft-recovery pass is documented in [PERFORMANCE-RELIABILITY.md](PERFORMANCE-RELIABILITY.md).
